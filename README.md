## Models used
['aya','mistral','llama3','phi3','gpt-4o','gpt-4-turbo','gpt-3.5-turbo-0125'] - all but the GPT are used as local models via Ollama API, GPT is used via Ollama API as well 

## Results
results are depicted in the JSON file, and in .md
Worth noting:
'aya' is a surprisingly mature model - producing good results
'gpt-4o' is 'the king' anyway IMHO
'mistral' created the story for children in English, instead of Czech
