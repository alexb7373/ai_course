### Homework Assignment: Plan for Customizing LLM for Error Log Summarization

#### Step-by-Step Plan:

1. **Define the Goal:**
   - The objective is to train a language model to process multiline log error messages and summarize the nature of the error in a concise and understandable manner.

2. **Data Collection:**

   - **ETL Log Files:** Collect historical log files from your ETL processes that include error messages, timestamps, and other relevant details.
   - **Error Documentation:** Gather documentation that describes the nature and resolution of various types of errors present in the logs.

3. **Data Preparation:**

   - **Cleaning the Data:** 
     - Remove irrelevant information and noise.
     - Standardize log messages (consistency in date/time formats, error codes, etc.).
   - **Structuring the Data:**
     - Convert multiline log messages into a format that pairs the log messages with their corresponding natural language summaries.
     
     Example JSON Structure:
     ```json
     {
         "data": [
             {
                 "error_log": "2023-02-01 12:34:56 ERROR [Component] FileNotFoundError: Exchange file not found for date 2023-02-01. \n Traceback (most recent call last): \n  ...",
                 "summary": "The exchange file for February 1, 2023, was not found. Check if the file exists and is correctly named."
             },
             ...
         ]
     }
     ```

4. **Dataset Split:**
   - **Training Set:** 70% of the collected data.
   - **Validation Set:** 15% of the data for model validation.
   - **Test Set:** 15% for final model evaluation.

### Example Dataset Entries:

- **Error Log:**
  ```
  2023-02-01 12:34:56 ERROR [Component] FileNotFoundError: Exchange file not found for date 2023-02-01.
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "main.py", line 23, in <module>
      fetch_data()
  FileNotFoundError: Exchange file not found at /data/exchange/2023-02-01.csv
  ```

  **Summary:** 
  "The exchange file for February 1, 2023, was not found. Check if the file exists and is correctly named."
